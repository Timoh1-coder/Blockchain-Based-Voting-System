Objective: Develop a proof-of-concept (POC) model for a voting system based on blockchain technology in FreeTON Network.
The POC model broadcasts the encrypted block of votes in blockchain. The nodes in the P2P network represent the voting machines. The encrypted block of votes is available at all nodes in the network in case the central storage of the votes is attacked.
To view results of project, clone the project and execute command "java -jar Blockchain_voting.jar".
